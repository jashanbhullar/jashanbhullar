## Hi, I am Jashanpreet Singh aka "json singh"

While working with computer was my choice, I didn't imagine it anything like what I do now. I thought it would cool like playing a game but turns out it's much more cooler than that sometimes, seeing those bits and pieces coming togther to create something "new", it feels like magic.

I have worked in various technologies but I am most experienced in Node.js, Postgres, AWS Cloud, Python, React.js which is enough to build any application you can think of. There's always room for learning so I am still learning, tinkering and hacking away at new stuff.

I have an active passion for satellite and geospatial data given my background in the same. Check out my talk [here](https://talks.osgeo.org/foss4g-2022/talk/YJPU9S/) on building a spatial temporal database.

### Full Set of technologies

- Backend - Node.js, Python, Go
- Frontend - React.js
- Cloud - AWS, Linode
- Other - Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, terraform

### Some common software engineering tasks I have worked on:

- Building a rest API server from scratch with ORM, caching and many middlewares with custom logic
- Building a frontend with all kinds of visualizations like chart, bar graphs, histograms etc
- Building authentication and authorization
- Dockering all kinds of applications written in Node, Python and Go for production as well as developer environment
- Setting linters, code formatter, testing using github actions
- Setting up CI/CD pipeline for auto deployments
- Setting up and configuring many AWS services like VPC, ECS, S3, Lambda etc
- Database migrations using pg_dump/pg_restore and pgBackRest
- Database modeling and optimizing query performance
- Setting up Kubernetes cluster for postgres cluster deployment

### Some of the interesting problem statements I have worked on:

- Building serverless scrapers using Node.js and Docker deployed on AWS lambda using Cloudformation to fetch data from different sites and store them in database or s3. Can be scaled to any number
- Streaming large chunks of data directly from memeory to storage. Implemented using node https and bufffer module
- Building a custom rules parser for an internal API gateway (cool stuff for authorization), based on logic used in AWS IAM (Deny first)
- Optimizing spatial joins on a postgis database using uber-h3

### What I am up for in future?

- New challenges and learning opportunties
- Give back to the community via open source or any other way
- Start a new company maybe?
