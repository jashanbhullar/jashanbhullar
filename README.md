## Hi, I am Jashanpreet Singh aka "json singh"

While working with a computer was my choice, I didn't imagine it anything like what I do now. I thought it would be cool like playing a game but it turns out it's much cooler than that sometimes, seeing those bits and pieces coming together to create something "new", feels like magic.

I have worked in various technologies but I am most experienced in Node.js, Postgres, AWS Cloud, Python, and React.js which is enough to build any application you can think of. There's always room for learning so I am still learning, tinkering, and hacking away at new stuff.

### Full Set of technologies

- Backend - Node.js, Python, Go
- Frontend - React.js
- Cloud - AWS, Linode
- Other - Docker, Kubernetes, Ansible, terraform

### Some of the interesting problem statements I have worked on:

- Building serverless scrapers using Node.js and Docker deployed on AWS lambda using Cloudformation to fetch data from different sites and store them in a database or s3. Can be scaled to any number
- Streaming large chunks of data directly from memory to storage. Implemented using node https and buffer module
- Building a custom rules parser for an internal API gateway (cool stuff for authorization), based on logic used in AWS IAM (Deny first)
- Optimizing spatial joins on a postgis database using uber-h3

### What am I looking for?

- New challenges and learning opportunities
- Give back to the community via open source or any other way
- Start a new company maybe?
