## Hi, I am Jashanpreet Singh aka "json singh"

While working with a computer was my choice, I didn't imagine it anything like what I do now. I thought it would be cool like playing a game but it turns out it's much cooler than that sometimes, seeing those bits and pieces coming together to create something "new", feels like magic.

I have worked in various technologies but I am most experienced in Node.js, Postgres, AWS Cloud, Python, and React.js which is enough to build any application I can think of. There's always room for learning so I am still learning, tinkering, and hacking away at new stuff.
